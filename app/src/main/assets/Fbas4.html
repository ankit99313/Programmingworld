        Q.What is difference between including the header file in angular braces <> and double quotes ?
    </b>
</p><p  style="font-size:16px;color:green">
    <b>Ans.</b> If a header file is included within < > then the compiler searches for the particular header file only within the
    built-in include path. If a header file is included within "", then the compiler searches for the particular header
    file first in the current working directory, if not found then in the built-in include path.
