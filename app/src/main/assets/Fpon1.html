        Q. What is difference between array and pointer ?
    </b>
</p><p style="font-size:16px;color:green">
    <b>Ans.</b> (i)An array is a collection of elements of similar data type whereas the pointer is a variable that
    stores the address of another variable.<br>
</p>
<p style="font-size:16px;color:green">
    (ii)An array size decides the number of variables it can store whereas; a pointer variable can store the
    address of only one variable in it.
</p>
<p style="font-size:16px;color:green">
    (iii)Arrays can be initialized at the definition, while pointers cannot be initialized at the definition.
</p>
<p style="font-size:16px;color:green">
    (iv)Arrays are allocated at compile time while pointers are allocated at the runtime.
</p>
<p style="font-size:16px;color:green">
    (v)Arrays are static in nature which means once the size of the array is declared, it cannot be resized
    according to users requirement. Whereas pointers are dynamic in nature, which means the memory allocated
    can be resized later at any point in time.
