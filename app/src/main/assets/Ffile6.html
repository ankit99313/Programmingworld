    <b>Q. What is difference between file opening mode r+ and w+ in C ?</b>
</p>
<p style="font-size:16px;color:green">
    <b>Ans.</b>
    Both r+ and w+ can read and write on the file. But r+ can't create a new file if such file doesn't exist and can't delete the content of the file, whereas w+ create it if it doesn't exit and can delete the content of the file.
