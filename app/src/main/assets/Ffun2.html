        Q. What is static function ?What is their use ?
    </b>
</p>
<p style="font-size:16px;color:green"><b>Ans.</b> In C,functions are global by default.The "static" keyword before a function name makes
it static.For example,<br>static int sum(int x,int y)<br>
    {<br>
return(x+y);<br>
    }</p>
<p style="font-size:16px;color:green">
Unlike global function in C,access to static functions is restricted to the file where they are declared
.Therefore, when we want to restrict access to functions, we make them static.</p></body></html>
