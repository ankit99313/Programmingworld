    Q. Why do we need prototype in function ?
    </b>
</p><p style="font-size:16px;color:green">
    <b>Ans.</b> The function prototypes are used to tell the compiler about the number of arguments and about the required
     datatype of a function parameter,it also tells about the return type of the function.By this information,
    the compiler cross-checks the function signatures before calling it. However it is not required to mention the function prototype but it is a best practice to use them.
