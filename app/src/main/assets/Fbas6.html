    control loop.  An entry control loop checks the condition at the time of entry and if the condition or expression
    (statement that has value) becomes true then control transfers into the body of the loop. Examples of exit controlled loop include, <b>For Loop</b> and <b>While Loop</b>.

<p style="font-size:16px;color:green"><b>Exit control loop</b>:An exit control loop, controls exit of the loop, thus why it is referred to as exit control
    loop. An exit control loop checks the condition for exit and if given condition for exit evaluate to true, control
    will exit from the loop body or else control will enter again into the loop. An example of exit controlled loop is
    <b>Do While Loop</b>.</p></body></html>
